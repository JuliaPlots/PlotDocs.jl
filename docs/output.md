# Output


**A Plot is only displayed when returned** (a semicolon will suppress the return), or if explicitly displayed with `display(plt)`, `gui()`, or by adding `show = true` to your plot command.


<div style="background-color: lightblue; padding: 10px; border-style: solid; border-width: medium; margin: 10px;">
Tip: You can have MATLAB-like interactive behavior by setting the default value: default(show = true)
</div>

### Standalone window

Calling `gui(plt)` will open a standalone window.  `gui()`, like `plot!(...)`, applies to the "current" Plot.  Returning a Plot object to the REPL is like calling `gui(plt)`.


### Jupyter / IJulia

Plots are shown inline when returned to a cell.  The default output format can be changed by the `html_output_format` attribute, with alias `fmt`:

```julia
plot(rand(10), fmt = :png)
```

### Juno / Atom

Plots are shown in the Atom PlotPane when possible, either when returned to the console or to an inline code block. At any time, the plot can be opened in a standalone window using the `gui()` command. The default behavior can be switched to match the REPL behavior (i.e. opening a standalone window) by setting `ENV["PLOTS_USE_ATOM_PLOTPANE"] = "false"` before loading Plots.

Note that javascript-based libraries (for example: PlotlyJS) cannot be shown in the PlotPane due to issues within Atom's internals.

### savefig / png

Save the most recent plot, choosing file type automatically by the extension.

```julia
savefig(filename)
```

There are also shorthands `png(fn)`, etc.  You don't need the file extension for those.
