# WARNING

https://github.com/JuliaPlots/PlotDocs.jl is now integrated into https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl for Plots v1 or v2, please make corresponding PRs or open issues there.

We only use the `gh-pages` branch of this repository to host the documentation (`stable`, `dev` and `preview`s) for Plots.

The old version of the docs are kept in the branch `old-gh-pages`.
*DO NOT* delete these !

Trigger the [Plots.jl docs building workflow](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl/actions/workflows/docs.yml) event on a specific tag in order to build the docs for a new release.
