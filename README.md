# WARNING

https://github.com/JuliaPlots/PlotDocs.jl is now integrated into https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl for Plots v1 or v2, please make corresponding PRs or open issues there.

We only use the `gh-pages` branch of this repository to host the documentation (`stable`, `dev` and `preview`s) for Plots.

The old version of the docs are kept in the branch `old-gh-pages`.

Do *NOT* delete these !
