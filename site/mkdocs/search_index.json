They follow consistent rules as much as possible, and you'll avoid common pitfalls if you read this section carefully:\n\n\n\n\nMany arguments have aliases which are \nreplaced during preprocessing\n.  \nc\n is the same as \ncolor\n, \nm\n is the same as \nmarker\n, etc.  You can choose a verbosity that you are comfortable with.\n\n\nThere are some \nspecial arguments\n which magically set many related things at once.\n\n\nIf the argument is a \"matrix-type\", then \neach column will map to a series\n, cycling through columns if there are fewer columns than series.  In this sense, a vector is treated just like an \"nx1 matrix\".\n\n\nMany arguments accept many different types... for example the color (also markercolor, fillcolor, etc) argument will accept strings or symbols with a color name, or any Colors.Colorant, or a ColorScheme, or a symbol representing a ColorGradient, or an AbstractVector of colors/symbols/etc...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUseful Tips\n\n\n\nTip: A common error is to pass a Vector when you intend for each item to apply to only one series.  Instead of an n-length Vector, pass a 1xn Matrix.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nTip: You can update certain plot settings after plot creation:\n\n  \n\n    plot!(title = \"New Title\", xlabel = \"New xlabel\", ylabel = \"New ylabel\")\n    plot!(xlims = (0, 5.5), ylims = (-2.2, 6), xticks = 0:0.5:10, yticks = [0,1,5,10])\n\n    # or using magic:\n    plot!(xaxis = (\"mylabel\", :log10, :flip))\n    xaxis!(\"mylabel\", :log10, :flip)\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: With \nsupported backends\n, you can pass a Plots.Shape object for the marker/markershape arguments.  Shape takes a vector of 2-tuples in the constructor, defining the points of the polygon's shape in a unit-scaled coordinate space.  To make a square, for example, you could do: Shape([(1,1),(1,-1),(-1,-1),(-1,1)])\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: You can see the default value for a given argument with default(arg::Symbol), and set the default value with default(arg::Symbol, value) or default(; kw...).  For example set the\ndefault window size and whether we should show a legend with default(size=(600,400), leg=false).\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: Call `gui()` to display the plot in a window.  Interactivity depends on backend.  Plotting at the REPL (without semicolon) implicitly calls `gui()`.\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: See the \nexamples\n for plotting ideas and features.",

Some valid examples:  plot ()                                      # empty Plot object  plot ( 4 )                                     # initialize with 4 empty series  plot ( rand ( 10 ))                              # 1 series... x = 1:10  plot ( rand ( 10 , 5 ))                            # 5 series... x = 1:10  plot ( rand ( 10 ),   rand ( 10 ))                    # 1 series  plot ( rand ( 10 , 5 ),   rand ( 10 ))                  # 5 series... y is the same for all  plot ( sin ,   rand ( 10 ))                         # y = sin(x)  plot ( rand ( 10 ),   sin )                         # same... y = sin(x)  plot ([ sin , cos ],   0 : 0.1 : \u03c0 )                    # 2 series, sin(x) and cos(x)  plot ([ sin , cos ],   0 ,   \u03c0 )                       # sin and cos on the range [0, \u03c0]  plot ( 1 : 10 ,   Any [ rand ( 10 ),   sin ])              # 2 series: rand(10) and map(sin,x)  plot ( dataset ( \"Ecdat\" ,   \"Airline\" ),   : Cost )    # the :Cost column from a DataFrame... must import StatPlots   Keyword arguments  allow for customization of the plot, subplots, axes, and series.  They follow consistent rules as much as possible, and you'll avoid common pitfalls if you read this section carefully:   Many arguments have aliases which are  replaced during preprocessing .   c  is the same as  color ,  m  is the same as  marker , etc.  You can choose a verbosity that you are comfortable with.  There are some  special arguments  which magically set many related things at once.  If the argument is a \"matrix-type\", then  each column will map to a series , cycling through columns if there are fewer columns than series.  In this sense, a vector is treated just like an \"nx1 matrix\".  Many arguments accept many different types... for example the color (also markercolor, fillcolor, etc) argument will accept strings or symbols with a color name, or any Colors.Colorant, or a ColorScheme, or a symbol representing a ColorGradient, or an AbstractVector of colors/symbols/etc...",

            "text": "Tip: A common error is to pass a Vector when you intend for each item to apply to only one series.  Instead of an n-length Vector, pass a 1xn Matrix.  \n   Tip: You can update certain plot settings after plot creation: \n   \n    plot!(title = \"New Title\", xlabel = \"New xlabel\", ylabel = \"New ylabel\")\n    plot!(xlims = (0, 5.5), ylims = (-2.2, 6), xticks = 0:0.5:10, yticks = [0,1,5,10])\n\n    # or using magic:\n    plot!(xaxis = (\"mylabel\", :log10, :flip))\n    xaxis!(\"mylabel\", :log10, :flip)\n     \nTip: With  supported backends , you can pass a Plots.Shape object for the marker/markershape arguments.  Shape takes a vector of 2-tuples in the constructor, defining the points of the polygon's shape in a unit-scaled coordinate space.  To make a square, for example, you could do: Shape([(1,1),(1,-1),(-1,-1),(-1,1)])  \nTip: You can see the default value for a given argument with default(arg::Symbol), and set the default value with default(arg::Symbol, value) or default(; kw...).  For example set the\ndefault window size and whether we should show a legend with default(size=(600,400), leg=false).  \nTip: Call `gui()` to display the plot in a window.  Interactivity depends on backend.  Plotting at the REPL (without semicolon) implicitly calls `gui()`.  \nTip: See the  examples  for plotting ideas and features.",

For example, \nplot(y, color = :blue)\n is really interpreted as \nplot(y, seriescolor = :blue)\n.  Each attribute has a number of aliases (see the charts below), which are available to avoid the pain of constantly looking up plotting API documentation because you forgot the argument name.  \nc\n, \ncolor\n, and \nseriescolor\n all mean the same thing, and in fact those are eventually converted into the more precise attributes \nlinecolor\n, \nmarkercolor\n, \nmarkerstrokecolor\n, and \nfillcolor\n (which you can then override if desired).\n\n\n\nTip: Use aliases for one-off analysis and visualization, but use the true keyword name for long-lived library code to avoid confusion.\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: As of this writing, aliases do not work inside recipes!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic Arguments\n\n\nSome arguments encompass smart shorthands for setting many related arguments at the same time.

It can create inline plots in IJulia, or open standalone browser windows when run from the Julia REPL.  plotlyjs()  is the preferred option, and taps into the great functionality of Spencer Lyon's PlotlyJS.jl.  Inline IJulia plots can be updated from any cell... something that\nmakes this backend stand out.  From the Julia REPL, it taps into Blink.jl and Electron to plot within a standalone GUI window... also very cool. Also, PlotlyJS supports saving the output to more formats than Plotly, such as EPS and PDF, and thus is the recommended version of Plotly for developing publication-quality figures.   Pros:   Tons of functionality  2D and 3D  Mature library  Interactivity (even when inline)  Standalone or inline   Cons:   No custom shapes  JSON may limit performance   Primary PlotlyJS.jl author: Spencer Lyon (@spencerlyon2)",

The first step in contributing will be to understand which package(s) are appropriate destinations for your code.\n\n\nPlots\n\n\nThis is the core package for:\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions of \nplot\n/\nplot!\n\n\nThe \ncore processing pipeline\n\n\nBase \nrecipes\n for \npath\n, \nscatter\n, \nbar\n, and many others\n\n\nGeneric \noutput\n methods\n\n\nGeneric \nlayout\n methods\n\n\nGeneric \nanimation\n methods\n\n\nGeneric types: Plot, Subplot, Axis, Series, ...\n\n\nConveniences: \ngetindex\n/\nsetindex\n, \npush!\n/\nappend!\n, \nunzip\n, \ncycle\n, ...\n\n\n\n\nThis package depends on RecipesBase, PlotUtils, and PlotThemes.  When contributing new functionality/features, you should make best efforts to find a more appropriate home (StatPlots, PlotUtils, etc) than contributing to core Plots.  In general, the push has been to reduce the size and scope of Plots, when possible, and move features to other packages.\n\n\nBackends\n\n\nIn Julia versions v0.5 and earlier, backend code (such as code linking Plots with GR) lived in the \nPlots/src/backends\n directory.  As such, backend code should be contributed to core Plots.\n\n\nStarting with v0.6, the backend code will live in separate repos, and loaded on demand.  For example, the GR backend is being developed at \nPlotsGR\n.  Users targeting v0.6 and later should contribute to the respective backend package \"Plots[backend].jl\".\n\n\nNote: As of 2/22/17, the \nreorg\n branch of Plots is needed for compatibility with the new backend repos.  This will be merged into the master branch sometime after the release of v0.6.\n\n\nThis redesign will help with improved support for precompilation, and a cleaner separation of \"generic plotting\" development and \"backend-specific\" development.\n\n\nPlotDocs\n\n\nPlotDocs is the home of this documentation.  The documentation is built using the \"material\" theme in \"mkdocs\".  For those contributing documentation (to the \ndocs\n directory of PlotDocs), it must be subsequently built and deployed using the following instructions:\n\n\n# Note: the site is built inside the PlotDocs.jl repo, but then deployed to the JuliaPlots organization page\n\n# To build, run from inside the PlotDocs directory:\n#     mkdocs build --clean\n# (optional) Make the githubio remote point to JuliaPlots/juliaplots.github.io:\n#     git remote add githubio git@github.com:JuliaPlots/juliaplots.github.io.git\n# Add files, commit, then push:\n#     git push origin master\n# Push just the site directory to the master branch of githubio\n#     git subtree push --prefix site githubio master\n\n\n\n\n\nRecipesBase\n\n\nSeldom updated, but essential.  This is the package that you would depend on to create third-party recipes.  It contains the bare minimum to define new recipes.\n\n\nPlotUtils\n\n\nComponents that could be used for other (non-Plots) packages.  Anything that is sufficiently generic and useful could be contributed here.\n\n\n\n\nColor (conversions, construction, conveniences)\n\n\nColor gradients/maps\n\n\nTick computation\n\n\n\n\nPlotThemes\n\n\nVisual themes (i.e. attribute defaults) such as \"dark\", \"orange\", etc.\n\n\nStatPlots\n\n\nAn extension of Plots: Statistical plotting and tabular data.  Complex histograms and densities, correlation plots, and support for DataFrames.  Anything related to stats or special handling for table-like data should live here.\n\n\nPlotRecipes\n\n\nAn extension of StatPlots: Graphs, maps, and more.  If it's not a \"base recipe\", and also not clearly \"statistical\" in nature, then this package might be a good home.\n\n\nMLPlots\n\n\nAn extension of PlotRecipes, geared toward Machine Learning applications: neural nets, spike trains, ROC curves, and more.\n\n\nGGPlots\n\n\nA prototype API/interface for \"Grammar of Graphics\" style plotting.  This likely wouldn't add actual functionality, but would give users coming from R/ggplot2 a simple way to avoid Gadfly.  I (Tom) wrote the prototype to show how easy it is, but since I dislike GoG-style, I never finished it.  Completing this package would be a great self-contained project for interested parties.\n\n\n\n\nChoosing a Project\n\n\nFor people new to Plots, the first step should be to read (and reread) the documentation.  Code up some examples, play with the attributes, and try out multiple backends.  It's really hard to contribute to a project that you don't know how to use.\n\n\nBeginner Project Ideas\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new recipe\n: Preferably something you care about.  Maybe you want custom overlays of heatmaps and scatters?  Maybe you have an input format that isn't currently supported?  Make a recipe for it so you can just \nplot(thing)\n.\n\n\nFix bugs\n: There are many \"bugs\" which are specific to one backend, or incorrectly implement features that are infrequently used.  Some ideas can be found in the \nissues marked easy\n.\n\n\nAdd recipes to external packages\n: By depending on RecipesBase, a package can define a recipe for their custom types.  Submit a PR to a package you care about that adds a recipe for that package.  For example, see \nthis PR to add OHLC plots for TimeSeries.jl\n.\n\n\n\n\nIntermediate Project Ideas\n\n\n\n\nImprove your favorite backend\n: There are many missing features and other improvements that can be made to individual backends.  Most issues specific to a backend have a \nspecial tag\n.\n\n\nHelp with documentation\n: This could come in the form of improved descriptions, additional examples, or full tutorials.  Please contribute improvements to \nPlotDocs\n.\n\n\nHelp with the v0.6 reorganization\n: The \nreorg\n requires the annoying effort of creating new repos (PlotsPyPlot, PlotsPlotlyJS, etc) that hold the backend code.  I consider this intermediate because you need to know a little about Plots and git, but it's fairly straightforward to follow the model of PlotsGR.\n\n\nExpand StatPlots functionality\n:  qqplot, DataStreams, or anything else you can think of.\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Project Ideas\n\n\n\n\nColorBar redesign\n: Colorbars \nneed serious love\n... this would likely require a new Colorbar type that links with the appropriate Series object(s) and is independent during subplot layout.  We want to allow many series (possibly from multiple subplots) to use the same clims and to share a colorbar, or have multiple colorbars that can be flexibly positioned.\n\n\nPlotSpec redesign\n: This \nlong standing redesign proposal\n could allow generic serialization/deserialization of Plot data and attributes, as well as some improvements/optimizations when mutating plots.  For example, we could lazily compute attribute values, and intelligently flag them as \"dirty\" when they change, allowing backends to skip much of the wasted processing and unnecessary rebuilding that currently occurs.\n\n\nImprove graph recipes\n: Lots to do here: clean up visuals, improve edge drawing, implement \nlayout algorithms\n, and much more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Design Principles\n\n\nFlexible and generic... these are the core principles underlying Plots development, and also tend to cause confusion when users laser-focus on their specific use case.\n\n\nI (Tom) have painstakingly designed the core logic to support nearly any use case that exists or may exist.  I don't pretend to know how you want to use Plots, or what type of data you might pass in, or what sort of recipe you may want to apply.  As such, I try to avoid unnecessary restriction of types, or forced conversions, or many other pitfalls of limited visualization frameworks.  The result is a highly modular framework which is limited by your imagination.\n\n\nWhen contributing new features to Plots (or the surrounding ecosystem), you should strive for this mentality as well.  New features should be left as generic as possible, while avoiding obvious feature clash.\n\n\nAs an example, you may want a new recipe that shows a histogram when passed Float64 numbers, but shows counts of every unique value for strings.  So you make a recipe that works perfectly for your purpose:\n\n\nusing\n \nPlots\n,\n \nStatsBase\n\n\ngr\n(\nsize\n=\n(\n300\n,\n300\n),\n \nleg\n=\nfalse\n)\n\n\n\n@userplot\n \nMyCount\n\n\n@recipe\n \nfunction\n \nf\n(\nmc\n::\nMyCount\n)\n\n    \n# get the array from the args field\n\n    \narr\n \n=\n \nmc\n.\nargs\n[\n1\n]\n\n\n    \nT\n \n=\n \ntypeof\n(\narr\n)\n\n    \nif\n \nT\n.\nparameters\n[\n1\n]\n \n==\n \nFloat64\n\n        \nseriestype\n \n:=\n \n:\nhistogram\n\n        \narr\n\n    \nelse\n\n        \nseriestype\n \n:=\n \n:\nbar\n\n        \ncm\n \n=\n \ncountmap\n(\narr\n)\n\n        \nx\n \n=\n \nsort!\n(\ncollect\n(\nkeys\n(\ncm\n)))\n\n        \ny\n \n=\n \n[\ncm\n[\nxi\n]\n \nfor\n \nxi\n=\nx\n]\n\n        \nx\n,\n \ny\n\n    \nend\n\n\nend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recipe defined above is a \"user recipe\", which builds a histogram for arrays of Float64, and otherwise shows a \"countmap\" of sorted unique values and their observed counts.  You only care about Float64 and String, and so you're results are fine:\n\n\nmycount\n(\nrand\n(\n500\n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmycount\n(\nrand\n([\n\"A\"\n,\n\"B\"\n,\n\"C\"\n],\n100\n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut you didn't consider the person that, in the future, might want to pass integers to this recipe:\n\n\nmycount\n(\nrand\n(\n1\n:\n500\n,\n \n500\n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis user expected integers to be treated as numbers and output a histogram, but instead they were treated like strings.  A simple solution would have been to replace \nif T.parameters[1] == Float64\n with \nif T.parameters[1] <: Number\n.  However, should we even depend on \nT\n having it's first parameter be the element type? (No)  So even better would be \nif eltype(arr) <: Number\n, which now allows any container with any numeric type to trigger the \"histogram\" logic.\n\n\nThis simple example outlines a common theme when developing Plots (or really any other Julia package).  Try to create the most generic implementation you can think of while maintaining correctness.  You don't know what crazy types someone else will use to try to access your functionality.\n\n\n\n\nCode Organization\n\n\nGenerally speaking, similar functionality is kept within the same file.  Within the \nsrc\n directory, much of the files should be self explanatory (for example, you'll find animation methods/macros in the \nanimation.jl\n file), but some could use a summary of contents:\n\n\n\n\nPlots.jl\n: imports, exports, shorthands, and initialization\n\n\nargs.jl\n: defaults, aliases, and attribute processing\n\n\ncomponents.jl\n: shapes, fonts, and other assorted goodies\n\n\npipeline.jl\n: code which builds the plots and subplots through recursive application of recipes\n\n\nrecipes.jl\n: primarily core series recipes\n\n\nseries.jl\n: core input data handling and processing\n\n\nutils.jl\n: lots of functionality that didn't have a home... \ngetindex\n/\nsetindex!\n for \nPlot\n/\nSubplot\n/\nAxis\n/\nSeries\n, \npush!\n/\nappend!\n for adding data to a series, \ncycle\n/\nunzip\n and similar utility functions, \nSegments\n/\nSegmentsIterator\n, etc.\n\n\n\n\nThese files should probably be reorganized, but until then...\n\n\nCreating new backends\n\n\nModel new backends on \nPlotsGR\n.  Implement the callbacks that are appropriate, especially \n_display\n and \n_show\n for GUI and image output respectively.\n\n\nStyle/Design Guidelines\n\n\n\n\nMake every effort to minimize external dependencies and exports.  Requiring new dependencies is the most likely way to make your PR \"unmergeable\".\n\n\nBe careful adding method signatures on existing methods with Base types (Array, etc) as you may override key functionality.  This is especially true with recipes.  Consider wrapping inputs in a new type (like in \"user recipes\").\n\n\nTerse code is ok, as is verbose code.  What's important is understanding and context.  Will someone reading your code know what you mean?  If not, consider writing comments to describe your reason for the design, or describe the hack you just implemented in clear prose.  Sometimes \nit's ok that your comments are longer than your code\n.\n\n\nPick your project for yourself, but write code for others.  It should be generic and useful beyond your needs, and you should \nnever break functionality\n because you can't figure out how to implement something well.  Spend more time on it... there's always a better way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGit-fu (or... the mechanics of contributing)\n\n\nMany people have trouble with Git.  More have trouble with Github.  I think much of the confusion happens when you run commands without understanding what they do.  We're all guilty of it, but recovering usually means \"starting over\".  In this section, I'll try to keep a simple, practical approach to making PRs.  It's worked well for me, though YMMV.\n\n\nGuidelines\n\n\nHere are some guidelines for the development workflow (Note: Even if you've made 20 PRs to Plots in the past, please read this as it may be different than past guidelines):\n\n\n\n\nCommit to a branch that belongs to you.\n  Typically that means you should give your branches names that are unique to you, and that might include information on the feature you're developing.  For example, I might choose to \ngit checkout -b tb-fonts\n when starting work on fonts.\n\n\nOpen a PR against master.\n  \nmaster\n is the \"bleeding edge\".  (Note: I used to recommend PRing to \ndev\n)\n\n\nOnly merge others changes when absolutely necessary.\n You should prefer to use \ngit rebase origin/master\n instead of \ngit merge origin/master\n.  A rebase replays your recent commits on top of the most recent \nmaster\n, avoiding complicated and messy merge commits and generally avoiding confusion.  If you follow the first rule, then you likely won't get yourself in trouble.  Rebase horror stories generally result when many people are working on the same branch.  I find \nthis resource\n is great for understanding the important parts of \ngit rebase\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment Workflow\n\n\nMy suggestions for a smooth development workflow:\n\n\nFork the repo\n\n\nNavigate to the repo site (https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl) and click the \"Fork\" button.  You might get a choice of which account or organization to place the fork.  I'll assume going forward that you forked to Github username \nuser123\n.\n\n\nSet up the git remote\n\n\nNavigate to the local repo.  Note: I'm assuming that you do development in your Julia directory, and using Mac/Linux.  Adjust as needed.\n\n\ncd ~/.julia/v0.5/Plots\ngit remote add forked git@github.com:user123/Plots.jl.git\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter running these commands, \ngit remote -v\n should show two remotes: \norigin\n (the main repo) and \nforked\n (your fork).  A remote is simply a reference/pointer to the github site hosting the repo, and a fork is simply any other git repo with a special link to the originating repo.\n\n\nCreate a new branch\n\n\nIf you're just starting work on a new feature:\n\n\ngit fetch origin\ngit checkout master\ngit merge --ff-only origin/master\ngit checkout -b user123-myfeature\ngit push -u forked user123-myfeature\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first three lines are meant to ensure you start from the main repo's master branch.  The \n--ff-only\n flag ensures you will only \"fast forward\" to newer commits, and avoids creating a new merge commit when you didn't mean to.  The \ngit checkout\n line both creates a new branch (the \n-b\n) pointing to the current commit and makes that branch current.  The \ngit push\n line adds this branch to your Github fork, and sets up the local branch to \"track\" (\n-u\n) the remote branch for subsequent \ngit push\n and \ngit pull\n calls.\n\n\nor... Reuse an old branch\n\n\nIf you have an ongoing development branch (say, \nuser123-dev\n) which you'd prefer to use (and which has previously been merged into master!) then you can get that up to date with:\n\n\ngit fetch origin\ngit checkout user123-dev\ngit merge --ff-only origin/master\ngit push forked user123-dev\n\n\n\n\n\nWe update our local copy of origin, checkout the dev branch, then attempt to \"fast-forward\" to the current master.  If successful, we push the branch back to our forked repo.\n\n\nWrite code and commit\n\n\nAfter powering up your favorite editor (maybe \nJuno\n?) and making some code changes to the repo, you'll want to \"commit\" or save a snapshot of all the changes you made.  After committing, you can \"push\" those changes to your forked repo on Github:\n\n\ngit add src/my_new_file.jl\ngit commit -am \"my commit message\"\ngit push forked user123-dev\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first line is optional, and is used when adding new files to the repo.  The \n-a\n means \"commit all my changes\", and the \n-m\n lets you write a note about the commit (you should always do this, and hopefully make it descriptive).\n\n\nSubmit a PR\n\n\nYou're almost there!  Browse to your fork (https://github.com/user123/Plots.jl).  Most likely there will be a section just above the code that asks if you'd like to create a PR from the \nuser123-dev\n branch.  If not, you can click the \"New pull request\" button.\n\n\nMake sure the \"base\" branch is JuliaPlots \nmaster\n and the \"compare\" branch is \nuser123-dev\n.  Add an informative title and description, and link to relevant issues or discussions, then click \"Create pull request\".  You may get some questions about it, and possibly suggestions of how to fix it to be \"merge-ready\".  Then hopefully it gets merged... thanks for the contribution!!\n\n\nCleanup\n\n\nAfter all of this, you will likely want to go back to using \nmaster\n (or possibly using a tagged release, once your feature is tagged).  To clean up:\n\n\ngit fetch origin\ngit checkout master\ngit merge --ff-only origin/master\ngit branch -d user123-dev\n\n\n\n\n\nThis catches your local master branch up to the remote master branch, then deletes the dev branch.  If you want to return to tagged releases, run \nPkg.free(\"Plots\")\n from the Julia REPL.\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\nNew tags should represent \"stable releases\"... those that you are happy to distribute to end-users.  Effort should be made to ensure tests pass before creating a new tag, and ideally new tests would be added which test your new functionality.  This is, of course, a much trickier problem for visualization libraries as compared to other software.  See the \ntesting section\n below.\n\n\nOnly JuliaPlots members may create a new tag.  To create a new tag, we'll create a new release on Github and use \nattobot\n to generate the PR to METADATA.  Create a new release at https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl/releases/new (of course replacing the repo name with the package you're tagging).\n\n\nThe version number (vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) should be incremented using \nsemver\n, which generally means that breaking changes should increment the major number, backwards compatible changes should increment the minor number, and bug fixes should increment the patch number.  For \"v0.x.y\" versions, this requirement is relaxed.  The minor version can be incremented for breaking changes.\n\n\n\n\nTesting\n\n\nVisualRegressionTests\n\n\nTesting in Plots is done with the help of \nVisualRegressionTests\n.  Reference images are stored in \nPlotReferenceImages\n. Sometimes the reference images need to be updated (if features change, or if the underlying backend changes).  VisualRegressionTests makes it somewhat painless to update the reference images:\n\n\nFrom the Julia REPL, run \ninclude(Pkg.dir(\"Plots\",\"test\",\"runtests.jl\"))\n.  This will try to plot the tests, and then compare the results to the stored reference images.  If the test output is sufficiently different than the reference output (using Tim Holy's excellent algorithm for the comparison), then a GTK window will pop up with a side-by-side comparison.  You can choose to replace the reference image, or not, depending on whether a real error was discovered.\n\n\nAfter the reference images have been updated, navigate to PlotReferenceImages and push the changes to Github:\n\n\ncd ~/.julia/v0.5/PlotReferenceImages\ngit add Plots/*\ngit commit -am \"a useful message\"\ngit push\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there are mis-matches due to bugs, \ndon't update the reference image\n.\n\n\nTravis\n\n\nOn a \ngit push\n, Travis tests will be triggered.  This runs the same tests as above, downloading and comparing to the reference images, though with a larger tolerance for differences.  When Travis errors, it may be due to timeouts, stale reference images, or a host of other reasons.  Check the \nTravis logs\n to determine the reason.  If the tests are broken because of a new commit, consider rolling back.",

I (Tom) have painstakingly designed the core logic to support nearly any use case that exists or may exist.  I don't pretend to know how you want to use Plots, or what type of data you might pass in, or what sort of recipe you may want to apply.  As such, I try to avoid unnecessary restriction of types, or forced conversions, or many other pitfalls of limited visualization frameworks.  The result is a highly modular framework which is limited by your imagination.  When contributing new features to Plots (or the surrounding ecosystem), you should strive for this mentality as well.  New features should be left as generic as possible, while avoiding obvious feature clash.  As an example, you may want a new recipe that shows a histogram when passed Float64 numbers, but shows counts of every unique value for strings.  So you make a recipe that works perfectly for your purpose:  using   Plots ,   StatsBase  gr ( size = ( 300 , 300 ),   leg = false )  @userplot   MyCount  @recipe   function   f ( mc :: MyCount ) \n     # get the array from the args field \n     arr   =   mc . args [ 1 ] \n\n     T   =   typeof ( arr ) \n     if   T . parameters [ 1 ]   ==   Float64 \n         seriestype   :=   : histogram \n         arr \n     else \n         seriestype   :=   : bar \n         cm   =   countmap ( arr ) \n         x   =   sort! ( collect ( keys ( cm ))) \n         y   =   [ cm [ xi ]   for   xi = x ] \n         x ,   y \n     end  end   The recipe defined above is a \"user recipe\", which builds a histogram for arrays of Float64, and otherwise shows a \"countmap\" of sorted unique values and their observed counts.  You only care about Float64 and String, and so you're results are fine:  mycount ( rand ( 500 ))    mycount ( rand ([ \"A\" , \"B\" , \"C\" ], 100 ))    But you didn't consider the person that, in the future, might want to pass integers to this recipe:  mycount ( rand ( 1 : 500 ,   500 ))    This user expected integers to be treated as numbers and output a histogram, but instead they were treated like strings.  A simple solution would have been to replace  if T.parameters[1] == Float64  with  if T.parameters[1] <: Number .  However, should we even depend on  T  having it's first parameter be the element type? (No)  So even better would be  if eltype(arr) <: Number , which now allows any container with any numeric type to trigger the \"histogram\" logic.  This simple example outlines a common theme when developing Plots (or really any other Julia package).  Try to create the most generic implementation you can think of while maintaining correctness.

There may be 8 attributes that are constant, but one that varies by data series.  We need to be able to easily layer complex plots on top of each other, and easily define what they should look like.  Input data might come in any form.\n\n\nI'll go through the steps that occur after a call to \nplot()\n or \nplot!()\n, and hint at the power and flexibility that arises.\n\n\nAn example command\n\n\nSuppose we have data:\n\n\nn\n \n=\n \n100\n\n\nx\n,\n \ny\n \n=\n \nlinspace\n(\n0\n,\n1\n,\nn\n),\n \nrandn\n(\nn\n,\n \n3\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand we'd like to visualize \nx\n against each column of \ny\n.

You have a Julia array? Great.  DataFrame? No problem.  Surface function? You got it.\n\n\nDuring this step, Plots will translate your input data (within the context of the plot type and other inputs) into a list of sliced and/or expanded representations,\nwhere each item represents the data for one plot series.  Under the hood, it makes heavy use of \nmultiple dispatch\n and \nrecipes\n.\n\n\nInputs are recursively processed until a matching recipe is found.  This means you can make modular and hierarchical recipes which are processed just like anything built into Plots.\n\n\ntype\n \nMyVecWrapper\n\n  \nv\n::\nVector\n{\nFloat64\n}\n\n\nend\n\n\nmv\n \n=\n \nMyVecWrapper\n(\nrand\n(\n100\n))\n\n\n\n@recipe\n \nfunction\n \nf\n(\nmv\n::\nMyVecWrapper\n)\n\n    \nmarkershape\n \n-->\n \n:\ncircle\n\n    \nmarkersize\n  \n-->\n \n30\n\n    \nmv\n.\nv\n\n\nend\n\n\n\nplot\n(\n\n    \nplot\n(\nmv\n.\nv\n),\n\n    \nplot\n(\nmv\n)\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that if dispatch does not find a recipe for the full combination of inputs, it will then try to apply \ntype recipes\n to each individual argument.\n\n\nThis hook gave us a nice way to swap out the input data and add custom visualization attributes for a user type.  Things like error bars, regression lines, ribbons, and group filtering are also handled during this recursive pass.\n\n\nGroups: When you'd like to split a data series into multiple plot series, you can use the \ngroup\n keyword.  Attributes can be applied to the resulting series as if your data had been already separated into distinct input data.  The \ngroup\n variable determines how to split the data and also assigns the legend label.\n\n\nIn this example, we split the data points into 3 groups randomly, and give them different marker shapes (\n[:s :o :x]\n are aliases for \n:star5\n, \n:octagon\n, and \n:xcross\n). The other attibutes (\n:markersize\n and \n:markeralpha\n) are shared.\n\n\nscatter\n(\nrand\n(\n100\n),\n \ngroup\n \n=\n \nrand\n(\n1\n:\n3\n,\n \n100\n),\n \nmarker\n \n=\n \n(\n10\n,\n0.3\n,[\n:\ns\n \n:\no\n \n:\nx\n]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3:  Initialize and update Plot and Subplots\n\n\nAttributes which apply to Plot, Subplot, or Axis objects are pulled out and processed.  Backend methods for initializing the figure/window are triggered, and the \nlayout\n is built.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Series Recipes\n\n\nThis part is somewhat magical.  Following the first three steps, we have a list of keyword dictionaries (type \nKW\n) which contain both data and attributes.  Now we will recursively apply \nseries recipes\n, first checking to see if a backend supports a series type natively, and if not, applying a series recipe and re-processing.\n\n\nThe result is that one can create generic recipes (converting a histogram to a bar plot, for example), which will reduce the series to the highest-level type(s) that a backend supports.  Since recipes are so simple to create, we can do complex visualizations in backends which support very little natively.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Preparing for output\n\n\nMuch of the heavy processing is offloaded until it's needed.  Plots will try to avoid expensive graphical updates until you actually choose to \ndisplay\n the plot.  Just before display, we will compute the layout specifics and bounding boxes of the subplots and other plot components, then trigger the callback to the backend code to draw/update the plot.\n\n\n\n\nStep 6: Display it\n\n\nOpen/refresh a GUI window, write to a file, or display inline in IJulia.  Remember that, in IJulia or the REPL, \na Plot is only displayed when returned\n (a semicolon will suppress the return), or if explicitly displayed with \ndisplay()\n, \ngui()\n, or by adding \nshow = true\n to your plot command.\n\n\n\nTip: You can have MATLAB-like interactive behavior by setting the default value: default(show = true)",

During this step, Plots will translate your input data (within the context of the plot type and other inputs) into a list of sliced and/or expanded representations,\nwhere each item represents the data for one plot series.  Under the hood, it makes heavy use of  multiple dispatch  and  recipes .  Inputs are recursively processed until a matching recipe is found.  This means you can make modular and hierarchical recipes which are processed just like anything built into Plots.  type   MyVecWrapper \n   v :: Vector { Float64 }  end  mv   =   MyVecWrapper ( rand ( 100 ))  @recipe   function   f ( mv :: MyVecWrapper ) \n     markershape   -->   : circle \n     markersize    -->   30 \n     mv . v  end  plot ( \n     plot ( mv . v ), \n     plot ( mv )  )    Note that if dispatch does not find a recipe for the full combination of inputs, it will then try to apply  type recipes  to each individual argument.  This hook gave us a nice way to swap out the input data and add custom visualization attributes for a user type.  Things like error bars, regression lines, ribbons, and group filtering are also handled during this recursive pass.  Groups: When you'd like to split a data series into multiple plot series, you can use the  group  keyword.  Attributes can be applied to the resulting series as if your data had been already separated into distinct input data.  The  group  variable determines how to split the data and also assigns the legend label.  In this example, we split the data points into 3 groups randomly, and give them different marker shapes ( [:s :o :x]  are aliases for  :star5 ,  :octagon , and  :xcross ). The other attibutes ( :markersize  and  :markeralpha ) are shared.  scatter ( rand ( 100 ),   group   =   rand ( 1 : 3 ,   100 ),   marker   =   ( 10 , 0.3 ,[ : s   : o   : x ]))",

A recipe is created by invoking the \n@recipe\n macro, which is defined in the lightweight package \nRecipesBase\n.  There are many examples of recipes both within Plots and in many external packages, including \nPlotRecipes\n.\n\n\nThere are four main types of recipes in Plots (listed in the order they are processed):\n\n\n\n\nUser Recipes\n\n\nType Recipes\n\n\nPlot Recipes\n\n\nSeries Recipes\n\n\n\n\nThe recipe type is determined completely by the dispatch signature.\n  Each recipe type is called from a different part of the \nplotting pipeline\n, so you will choose a type of recipe to match how much processing you want completed before your recipe is applied.\n\n\nThese are the dispatch signatures for each type (note that most of these can accept positional or keyword args, denoted by \n...\n):\n\n\n\n\nUser Recipes: \n@recipe function f(custom_arg_1::T, custom_arg_2::S, ...; ...) end\n\n\nProcess a unique set of types early in the pipeline.  Good for user-defined types or special combinations of Base types.\n\n\nThe \n@userplot\n macro is a nice convenience which both defines a new type (to ensure correct dispatch) and exports shorthands.\n\n\nSee \ngraphplot\n for an example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType Recipes: \n@recipe function f{T<:MyType}(::Type{T}, val::T) end\n\n\nFor user-defined types which wrap or have a one-to-one mapping to something supported by Plots, simply define a conversion method.\n\n\nNote: this is effectively saying \"when you see type T, replace it with ...\"\n\n\nSee \nSymPy\n for an example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot Recipes: \n@recipe function f(::Type{Val{:myplotrecipename}}, plt::AbstractPlot; ...) end\n\n\nThese are called after input data has been processed, but \nbefore the plot is created\n.\n\n\nBuild layouts, add subplots, and other plot-wide attributes\n\n\nSee \nmarginalhist\n for an example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeries Recipes: \n@recipe function f(::Type{Val{:myseriesrecipename}}, x, y, z; ...) end\n\n\nThese are the last calls to happen.  Each backend will support a short list of series types (\npath\n, \nshape\n, \nhistogram\n, etc).  If a series type is natively supported, processing is passed (delegated) to the backend.  If a series type is \nnot\n natively supported by the backend, we attempt to call a \"series recipe\".\n\n\nNote: If there's no series recipe defined, and the backend doesn't support it, you'll see an error like: \nERROR: The backend must not support the series type Val{:hi}, and there isn't a series recipe defined.\n\n\nNote: You must have the \nx, y, z\n included in the signature, or it won't be processed as a series type!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecipe Syntax/Rules\n\n\nLets decompose what's happening inside the recipe macro, starting with a simple recipe:\n\n\ntype\n \nMyType\n \nend\n\n\n\n@recipe\n \nfunction\n \nf\n(\n::\nMyType\n,\n \nn\n::\nInteger\n \n=\n \n10\n;\n \nadd_marker\n \n=\n \nfalse\n)\n\n    \nlinecolor\n   \n-->\n \n:\nblue\n\n    \nseriestype\n  \n:=\n  \n:\npath\n\n    \nmarkershape\n \n-->\n \n(\nadd_marker\n \n?\n \n:\ncircle\n \n:\n \n:\nnone\n)\n\n    \ndelete!\n(\nd\n,\n \n:\nadd_marker\n)\n\n    \nrand\n(\nn\n)\n\n\nend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe create a new type \nMyType\n, which is empty, and used purely for dispatch.  Our goal here is to create a random path of \nn\n points.\n\n\nThere are a few important things to know, after which recipes boil down to updating an attribute dictionary and returning input data:\n\n\n\n\nA recipe signature \nf(args...; kw...)\n is converted into a definition of \napply_recipe(d::KW, args...)\n where:\n\n\nd\n is an attribute dictionary of type \ntypealias KW Dict{Symbol,Any}\n\n\nYour \nargs\n must be distinct enough that dispatch will call your definition (and without masking an existing definition).  Using a custom data type will ensure proper dispatch.\n\n\nThe function \nf\n is unused/meaningless... call it whatever you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe special operator \n-->\n turns \nlinecolor --> :blue\n into \nget!(d, :linecolor, :blue)\n, setting the attribute only when it doesn't already exist.  (Tip: Wrap the right hand side in parentheses for complex expressions.)\n\n\nThe special operator \n:=\n turns \nseriestype := :path\n into \nd[:seriestype] = :path\n, forcing that attribute value.  (Tip: Wrap the right hand side in parentheses for complex expressions.)\n\n\nThe return value of the recipe is the \nargs\n of a \nRecipeData\n object, which also has a reference to the attribute dictionary.\n\n\nA recipe returns a Vector{RecipeData}.  We'll see how to add to this list later with the \n@series\n macro.\n\n\n\n\nBreaking down the example:\n\n\nIn the example above, we use \nMyType\n for dispatch, with optional positional argument \nn::Integer\n:\n\n\n@recipe\n \nfunction\n \nf\n(\n::\nMyType\n,\n \nn\n::\nInteger\n \n=\n \n10\n;\n \nadd_marker\n \n=\n \nfalse\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a call to \nplot(MyType())\n or similar, this recipe will be invoked.

User recipes (like others) can be stacked and modular.  The following is valid:\n\n\n@recipe\n \nf\n(\nmt\n::\nMyType\n,\n \nn\n::\nInteger\n \n=\n \n10\n)\n \n=\n \n(\nmt\n,\n \nrand\n(\nn\n))\n\n\n@recipe\n \nf\n(\nmt\n::\nMyType\n,\n \nv\n::\nAbstractVector\n)\n \n=\n \nhist\n(\nv\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere a call to \nplot(MyType())\n will apply these recipes in order; first mapping \nmt\n to \n(mt, rand(10))\n and then subsequently mapping to \nhist(rand(10))\n.\n\n\n\n\nType Recipes\n\n\nFor some custom data types, they are essentially light wrappers around built-in containers.  For example you may have a type:\n\n\ntype\n \nMyWrapper\n\n    \nv\n::\nVector\n\n\nend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, you'd like your \nMyWrapper\n objects to be treated just like Vectors, but do not wish to subtype AbstractArray.  No worries!  Just define a type recipe to do the conversion:\n\n\n@recipe\n \nf\n(\n::\nType\n{\nMyWrapper\n},\n \nmw\n::\nMyWrapper\n)\n \n=\n \nmw\n.\nv\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis signature is called on each input when dispatch did not find a suitable recipe for the full \nargs...\n.  So \nplot(rand(10), MyWrapper(rand(10)))\n will \"just work\".\n\n\n\n\nSeries Recipes\n\n\nThis is where the magic happens.  You can create your own custom visualizations for arbitrary data.  Quickly define violin plots, error bars, and even standard types like histograms and step plots.  A histogram is a bar plot:\n\n\n@recipe\n \nfunction\n \nf\n(\n::\nType\n{\nVal\n{\n:\nhistogram\n}},\n \nx\n,\n \ny\n,\n \nz\n)\n\n    \nedges\n,\n \ncounts\n \n=\n \nmy_hist\n(\ny\n,\n \nd\n[\n:\nbins\n],\n\n                               \nnormed\n \n=\n \nd\n[\n:\nnormalize\n],\n\n                               \nweights\n \n=\n \nd\n[\n:\nweights\n])\n\n    \nx\n \n:=\n \nedges\n\n    \ny\n \n:=\n \ncounts\n\n    \nseriestype\n \n:=\n \n:\nbar\n\n    \n()\n\n\nend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhile a 2D histogram is really a heatmap:\n\n\n@recipe\n \nfunction\n \nf\n(\n::\nType\n{\nVal\n{\n:\nhistogram2d\n}},\n \nx\n,\n \ny\n,\n \nz\n)\n\n    \nxedges\n,\n \nyedges\n,\n \ncounts\n \n=\n \nmy_hist_2d\n(\nx\n,\n \ny\n,\n \nd\n[\n:\nbins\n],\n\n                                              \nnormed\n \n=\n \nd\n[\n:\nnormalize\n],\n\n                                              \nweights\n \n=\n \nd\n[\n:\nweights\n])\n\n    \nx\n \n:=\n \ncenters\n(\nxedges\n)\n\n    \ny\n \n:=\n \ncenters\n(\nyedges\n)\n\n    \nz\n \n:=\n \nSurface\n(\ncounts\n)\n\n    \nseriestype\n \n:=\n \n:\nheatmap\n\n    \n()\n\n\nend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe argument \ny\n is always populated, the argument \nx\n is populated with a call like \nplot(x,y, seriestype =: histogram2d)\n and correspondingly for \nz\n, \nplot(x,y,z, seriestype =: histogram2d)\n\n\nSee below where I go through a series recipe for creating boxplots.

This is a nice example because, although easy to understand, it utilizes some great Plots features.\n\n\nMarginal histograms are a visualization comparing two variables.  The main plot is a 2D histogram, where each rectangle is a (possibly normalized and weighted) count of data points in that bucket.  Above the main plot is a smaller histogram of the first variable, and to the right of the main plot is a histogram of the second variable.

It also creates lowercase convenience methods (\nmarginalhist\n and \nmarginalhist!\n) and exports them.\n\n\n@userplot\n \nMarginalHist\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthus create a type \nMarginalHist\n for dispatch. An object of type \nMarginalHist\n has the field \nargs\n which is the tuple of arguments the plot function is invoked with, which can be either \nmarginalhist(x,y,...)\n or \nplot(x,y, seriestype = :marginalhist)\n. The first syntax is a shorthand created by the \n@userplot\n macro.\n\n\nWe dispatch only on the generated type, as the real inputs are wrapped inside it:\n\n\n@recipe\n \nfunction\n \nf\n(\nh\n::\nMarginalHist\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome error checking.  Note that we're extracting the real inputs (like in a call to \nmarginalhist(randn(100), randn(100))\n) into \nx\n and \ny\n:\n\n\n    \nif\n \nlength\n(\nh\n.\nargs\n)\n \n!=\n \n2\n \n||\n \n!\n(\ntypeof\n(\nh\n.\nargs\n[\n1\n])\n \n<:\n \nAbstractVector\n)\n \n||\n \n!\n(\ntypeof\n(\nh\n.\nargs\n[\n2\n])\n \n<:\n \nAbstractVector\n)\n\n        \nerror\n(\n\"Marginal Histograms should be given two vectors.

A few things to note:\n\n\n- The layout creates three subplots (`_` is left blank)\n- Attributes are mapped to each subplot when passed in as a matrix (row-vector)\n- The attribute `link := :both` means that the y-axes of each row (and x-axes of\n    each column) will share data extrema.  Other values include `:x`, `:y`,\n    `:all`, and `:none`.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n# set up the subplots\n\n    \nlegend\n \n:=\n \nfalse\n\n    \nlink\n \n:=\n \n:\nboth\n\n    \nticks\n \n:=\n \n[\nnothing\n \n:\nauto\n \nnothing\n]\n\n    \ngrid\n \n:=\n \nfalse\n\n    \nforeground_color_subplot\n \n:=\n \n[\nRGBA\n(\n0\n,\n0\n,\n0\n,\n0\n)\n \n:\nmatch\n \nRGBA\n(\n0\n,\n0\n,\n0\n,\n0\n)]\n\n    \nlayout\n \n:=\n \n@layout\n \n[\ntophist\n           \n_\n\n                       \nhist2d\n{\n0.9\nw\n,\n0.9\nh\n}\n \nrighthist\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefine the series of the main plot.  The \n@series\n macro makes a local copy of the attribute dictionary \nd\n using a \"let block\".  The copied dictionary and the returned args are added to the \nVector{RecipeData}\n which is returned from the recipe.  This block is similar to calling \nhistogram2d!(x, y; subplot = 2, d...)\n (but you wouldn't actually want to do that).\n\n\nNote: this \n@series\n block gets a \"snapshot\" of the attributes, so it contains anything that was set before this block, but nothing from after it.  \n@series\n blocks can be standalone, as these are, or they can be in a loop.\n\n\n    \n# main histogram2d\n\n    \n@series\n \nbegin\n\n        \nseriestype\n \n:=\n \n:\nhistogram2d\n\n        \nsubplot\n \n:=\n \n2\n\n        \nx\n,\n \ny\n\n    \nend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext we move on to the marginal plots.  We first set attributes which are shared by both:\n\n\n    \n# these are common to both marginal histograms\n\n    \nfillcolor\n \n:=\n \n:\nblack\n\n    \nfillalpha\n \n:=\n \n0.3\n\n    \nlinealpha\n \n:=\n \n0.3\n\n    \nseriestype\n \n:=\n \n:\nhistogram\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we create two more series, one for each histogram.\n\n\n    \n# upper histogram\n\n    \n@series\n \nbegin\n\n        \nsubplot\n \n:=\n \n1\n\n        \nx\n\n    \nend\n\n\n    \n# right histogram\n\n    \n@series\n \nbegin\n\n        \norientation\n \n:=\n \n:\nh\n\n        \nsubplot\n \n:=\n \n3\n\n        \ny\n\n    \nend\n\n\nend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's important to note: normally we would return arguments from a recipe, and those arguments would be added to a \nRecipeData\n object and pushed onto our \nVector{RecipeData}\n.  However, when creating series using the \n@series\n macro, you have the option of returning \nnothing\n, which will bypass that last step.\n\n\n\n\nSeries Recipe - Notched Box Plots\n\n\nTODO\n\n\n\n\nDocumenting plot functions\n\n\nA documentation string added above the recipe definition will have no effect, just like the function name is meaningless. Since everything in Julia can be associated with a doc-string, the documentation can be added to the name of the plot function like this\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\nMy docstring\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\nmy_plotfunc\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can be put anywhere in the code and will appear on the call \n?my_plotfunc\n.\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nIt can sometimes be helpful when debugging recipes to see the order of dispatch inside the \napply_recipe\n calls.  Turn on debugging info with:\n\n\nRecipesBase\n.\ndebug\n()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also pass a \nBool\n to the \ndebug\n method to turn it on/off.\n\n\nHere are some common errors, and what to look out for:\n\n\nconvertToAnyVector\n\n\nERROR\n:\n \nIn\n \nconvertToAnyVector\n,\n \ncould\n \nnot\n \nhandle\n \nthe\n \nargument\n \ntypes\n:\n \n<<\nsome\n \ntype\n>>\n\n    \n[\ninlined\n \ncode\n]\n \nfrom\n \n~/\n.\njulia\n/\nv0\n.4\n/\nPlots\n/\nsrc\n/\nseries_new\n.\njl\n:\n87\n\n    \nin\n \napply_recipe\n \nat\n \n~/\n.\njulia\n/\nv0\n.4\n/\nRecipesBase\n/\nsrc\n/\nRecipesBase\n.\njl\n:\n237\n\n    \nin\n \n_plot\n!\n \nat\n \n~/\n.\njulia\n/\nv0\n.4\n/\nPlots\n/\nsrc\n/\nplot\n.\njl\n:\n312\n\n    \nin\n \nplot\n \nat\n \n~/\n.\njulia\n/\nv0\n.4\n/\nPlots\n/\nsrc\n/\nplot\n.\njl\n:\n52\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis error occurs when the input types could not be handled by a recipe.

            "text": "Like other tools in Plots, recipes are relatively simple, but extremely powerful.  A recipe is created by invoking the  @recipe  macro, which is defined in the lightweight package  RecipesBase .  There are many examples of recipes both within Plots and in many external packages, including  PlotRecipes .  There are four main types of recipes in Plots (listed in the order they are processed):   User Recipes  Type Recipes  Plot Recipes  Series Recipes   The recipe type is determined completely by the dispatch signature.   Each recipe type is called from a different part of the  plotting pipeline , so you will choose a type of recipe to match how much processing you want completed before your recipe is applied.  These are the dispatch signatures for each type (note that most of these can accept positional or keyword args, denoted by  ... ):   User Recipes:  @recipe function f(custom_arg_1::T, custom_arg_2::S, ...; ...) end  Process a unique set of types early in the pipeline.  Good for user-defined types or special combinations of Base types.  The  @userplot  macro is a nice convenience which both defines a new type (to ensure correct dispatch) and exports shorthands.  See  graphplot  for an example.    Type Recipes:  @recipe function f{T<:MyType}(::Type{T}, val::T) end  For user-defined types which wrap or have a one-to-one mapping to something supported by Plots, simply define a conversion method.  Note: this is effectively saying \"when you see type T, replace it with ...\"  See  SymPy  for an example.    Plot Recipes:  @recipe function f(::Type{Val{:myplotrecipename}}, plt::AbstractPlot; ...) end  These are called after input data has been processed, but  before the plot is created .  Build layouts, add subplots, and other plot-wide attributes  See  marginalhist  for an example.    Series Recipes:  @recipe function f(::Type{Val{:myseriesrecipename}}, x, y, z; ...) end  These are the last calls to happen.  Each backend will support a short list of series types ( path ,  shape ,  histogram , etc).  If a series type is natively supported, processing is passed (delegated) to the backend.  If a series type is  not  natively supported by the backend, we attempt to call a \"series recipe\".  Note: If there's no series recipe defined, and the backend doesn't support it, you'll see an error like:  ERROR: The backend must not support the series type Val{:hi}, and there isn't a series recipe defined.  Note: You must have the  x, y, z  included in the signature, or it won't be processed as a series type!!",

            "text": "Lets decompose what's happening inside the recipe macro, starting with a simple recipe:  type   MyType   end  @recipe   function   f ( :: MyType ,   n :: Integer   =   10 ;   add_marker   =   false ) \n     linecolor     -->   : blue \n     seriestype    :=    : path \n     markershape   -->   ( add_marker   ?   : circle   :   : none ) \n     delete! ( d ,   : add_marker ) \n     rand ( n )  end   We create a new type  MyType , which is empty, and used purely for dispatch.  Our goal here is to create a random path of  n  points.  There are a few important things to know, after which recipes boil down to updating an attribute dictionary and returning input data:   A recipe signature  f(args...; kw...)  is converted into a definition of  apply_recipe(d::KW, args...)  where:  d  is an attribute dictionary of type  typealias KW Dict{Symbol,Any}  Your  args  must be distinct enough that dispatch will call your definition (and without masking an existing definition).  Using a custom data type will ensure proper dispatch.  The function  f  is unused/meaningless... call it whatever you want.    The special operator  -->  turns  linecolor --> :blue  into  get!(d, :linecolor, :blue) , setting the attribute only when it doesn't already exist.  (Tip: Wrap the right hand side in parentheses for complex expressions.)  The special operator  :=  turns  seriestype := :path  into  d[:seriestype] = :path , forcing that attribute value.  (Tip: Wrap the right hand side in parentheses for complex expressions.)  The return value of the recipe is the  args  of a  RecipeData  object, which also has a reference to the attribute dictionary.  A recipe returns a Vector{RecipeData}.  We'll see how to add to this list later with the  @series  macro.   Breaking down the example:  In the example above, we use  MyType  for dispatch, with optional positional argument  n::Integer :  @recipe   function   f ( :: MyType ,   n :: Integer   =   10 ;   add_marker   =   false )   With a call to  plot(MyType())  or similar, this recipe will be invoked.  If  linecolor  has not been set, it is set to  :blue :       linecolor     -->   : blue   The  seriestype  is forced to be  :path :       seriestype    :=    : path   The  markershape  is a little more complex; it checks the  add_marker  custom keyword, but only if  markershape  was not already set.  (Note: the  add_marker  key is redundant, as the user can just set the marker shape directly... I use it only for demonstration):       markershape   -->   ( add_marker   ?   : circle   :   : none )   then return the data to be plotted:       rand ( n )  end   Some example usages of our (mostly useless) recipe:  mt   =   MyType ()  plot ( \n     plot ( mt ), \n     plot ( mt ,   100 ,   linecolor   =   : red ), \n     plot ( mt ,   marker   =   ( : star , 20 ),   add_marker   =   false ), \n     plot ( mt ,   add_marker   =   true )  )",

            "text": "In this case study, I'll explain how I built the  marginalhist  recipe for  PlotRecipes .  This is a nice example because, although easy to understand, it utilizes some great Plots features.  Marginal histograms are a visualization comparing two variables.  The main plot is a 2D histogram, where each rectangle is a (possibly normalized and weighted) count of data points in that bucket.  Above the main plot is a smaller histogram of the first variable, and to the right of the main plot is a histogram of the second variable.

It also creates lowercase convenience methods ( marginalhist  and  marginalhist! ) and exports them.  @userplot   MarginalHist   thus create a type  MarginalHist  for dispatch. An object of type  MarginalHist  has the field  args  which is the tuple of arguments the plot function is invoked with, which can be either  marginalhist(x,y,...)  or  plot(x,y, seriestype = :marginalhist) . The first syntax is a shorthand created by the  @userplot  macro.  We dispatch only on the generated type, as the real inputs are wrapped inside it:  @recipe   function   f ( h :: MarginalHist )   Some error checking.  Note that we're extracting the real inputs (like in a call to  marginalhist(randn(100), randn(100)) ) into  x  and  y :       if   length ( h . args )   !=   2   ||   ! ( typeof ( h . args [ 1 ])   <:   AbstractVector )   ||   ! ( typeof ( h . args [ 2 ])   <:   AbstractVector ) \n         error ( \"Marginal Histograms should be given two vectors.  Got:  $ ( typeof ( h . args )) \" ) \n     end \n     x ,   y   =   h . args   Next we build the subplot layout and define some attributes.  A few things to note:  - The layout creates three subplots (`_` is left blank)\n- Attributes are mapped to each subplot when passed in as a matrix (row-vector)\n- The attribute `link := :both` means that the y-axes of each row (and x-axes of\n    each column) will share data extrema.  Other values include `:x`, `:y`,\n    `:all`, and `:none`.       # set up the subplots \n     legend   :=   false \n     link   :=   : both \n     ticks   :=   [ nothing   : auto   nothing ] \n     grid   :=   false \n     foreground_color_subplot   :=   [ RGBA ( 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 )   : match   RGBA ( 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 )] \n     layout   :=   @layout   [ tophist             _ \n                        hist2d { 0.9 w , 0.9 h }   righthist ]   Define the series of the main plot.  The  @series  macro makes a local copy of the attribute dictionary  d  using a \"let block\".  The copied dictionary and the returned args are added to the  Vector{RecipeData}  which is returned from the recipe.  This block is similar to calling  histogram2d!(x, y; subplot = 2, d...)  (but you wouldn't actually want to do that).  Note: this  @series  block gets a \"snapshot\" of the attributes, so it contains anything that was set before this block, but nothing from after it.   @series  blocks can be standalone, as these are, or they can be in a loop.       # main histogram2d \n     @series   begin \n         seriestype   :=   : histogram2d \n         subplot   :=   2 \n         x ,   y \n     end   Next we move on to the marginal plots.  We first set attributes which are shared by both:       # these are common to both marginal histograms \n     fillcolor   :=   : black \n     fillalpha   :=   0.3 \n     linealpha   :=   0.3 \n     seriestype   :=   : histogram   Now we create two more series, one for each histogram.       # upper histogram \n     @series   begin \n         subplot   :=   1 \n         x \n     end \n\n     # right histogram \n     @series   begin \n         orientation   :=   : h \n         subplot   :=   3 \n         y \n     end  end   It's important to note: normally we would return arguments from a recipe, and those arguments would be added to a  RecipeData  object and pushed onto our  Vector{RecipeData} .  However, when creating series using the  @series  macro, you have the option of returning  nothing , which will bypass that last step.",

This allows it to be used as a plug-and-play module with general reinforcement learning agents.\n\n\nGames can also be \"plotted\" using Plots.jl, allowing it to be a component of more complex visualizations for tracking learning progress and more, as well as making it easy to create animations.\n\n\n\n\nReinforce\n\n\nReinforce.jl is an interface for Reinforcement Learning.

This is achieved using probabilistic transformation pipelines.\n\n\n\n\nDifferentialEquations\n\n\nDifferentialEquations.jl is a package for solving numerically solving differential equations in Julia by Chris Rackauckas. The purpose of this package is to supply efficient Julia implementations of solvers for various differential equations. Equations within the realm of this package include ordinary differential equations (ODEs), stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs or SDEs), stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), partial differential equations (with both finite difference and finite element methods), differential algebraic equations, and differential delay equations. It includes well-optimized implementations classic algorithms and ones from recent research, including algorithms optimized for high-precision and HPC applications.\n\n\nAll of the solvers return solution objects which are set up with plot recipes to give informative default plots.\n\n\n\n\nPhyloTrees\n\n\nThe PhyloTrees.jl package provides a type representation of phylogenetic trees. Simulation, inference, and visualization functionality is also provided for phylogenetic trees. A plot recipe allows the structure of phylogenetic trees to be drawn by whichever plotting backend is preferred by the user.\n\n\n\n\nEEG\n\n\nProcess EEG files and visualize brain activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplicitEquations\n\n\nIn a paper, Tupper presents a method for graphing two-dimensional implicit equations and inequalities. This package gives an implementation of the paper's basic algorithms to allow the Julia user to naturally represent and easily render graphs of implicit functions and equations.\n\n\n\n\nControlSystems\n\n\nA control systems design toolbox for Julia.  This toolbox works similar to that of other major computer-aided control systems design (CACSD) toolboxes. Systems can be created in either a transfer function or a state space representation. These systems can then be combined into larger architectures, simulated in both time and frequency domain, and analyzed for stability/performance properties.\n\n\n\n\nValueHistories\n\n\nUtility package for efficient tracking of optimization histories, training curves or other information of arbitrary types and at arbitrarily spaced sampling times\n\n\n\n\nApproxFun\n\n\nApproxFun is a package for approximating functions.
